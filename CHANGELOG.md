## 3.0.1

This new version completely changes the UI so can't really cover in a changelog but I'll \
mention some important changes that users might notice
And ofcourse, the name now is `SMASSH` because `termtyper` was too generic

### Added

- Add support for multiple languages. See WIKI
- Add support for multiple themes

### Removed

- Removed mechanical sounds (I'll work on this in the later versions)
